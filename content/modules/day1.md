Welcome to the Graduate Student Research Institute (GSRI). GSRI is a five-day, asynchronous online learning experience, and is intended to benefit graduate students through:

- Skill-building
- Community-building
- Information
- Preparedness

By the end of this Institute, you will have gained insight into research skills and resources, as well as the importance of mentorship and community and how to make those connections with others. Our goal is for you to leave this week prepared with the knowledge needed to engage in successful research projects as a UW graduate student.

## What is Graduate School?

Graduate education encompasses research, study, and teaching beyond the bachelorâ€™s degree. Many of you may have a lot of positive expectations for your graduate school experience, while also having some trepidation about the amount of time and effort involved. This is totally normal!

Graduate school and the associated research, coursework, and/or teaching will be demanding, but the good news is that you will have the chance to work with faculty, advisors, librarians, and fellow students who will support and guide you through this experience. Completion of your program will open professional and academic doors for you that will lead to even further successes, so take a moment to congratulate yourself on embarking on this transformative journey!

### Keys to success: How to flourish in Grad School

#### Set yourself up for success!

Make connections, find your people, and know that you belong here. Mentorship is a huge element in establishing your path to graduation and future successes! The coming days in the Institute will help you make those connections.

#### Take it one day at a time!

This is a marathon, but there are days it will feel like an all-out sprint. Budget your time and prioritize; chipping away at manageable chunks of work will have you succeeding -- one day at a time.

#### Take control of your schedule!

While each day brings you closer to your end goal, remember that an extra hour spent with family or in self-care won't wreck all your plans. It is paramount that you practice self-care and manage your calendar, after all, it is yours to control.

## What is Graduate-Level Research?

Graduate student research isn't a special type of research in and of itself. However, many graduate programs do expect students to acquire more specialized, in-depth, and original skills when it comes to conducting research in their fields. By learning how to add your voice to research conversations going on around you, you will prepare yourself not only for success in graduate school, but also in the world beyond it.

Let's consider for a moment this idea of research as a type of conversation.

## Research is a Conversation

We're doing research all the time-- whether for a lab, course paper, or graduate level thesis. Research is all about listening, reading, asking questions and eventually responding. For scholars, research never happens in a vacuum, but is always informed by the vast amount of writing and discoveries that already exist or are in progress. Research is a product of many different voices over time and space, so remember that you are never truly alone when doing research. Over the next several days, we'll present you with more resources, tips, and tricks for doing scholarly research.

### What's been said? What's left to say?

Knowing what's already been thoroughly researched and what questions still exist in your field will help you to smoothly enter the research conversation and find an original niche. You can do background research by identifying the big researchers in your discipline and where their ideas are being published. This happens over time, so don't rush the process of gathering information. Start off by getting tips from your advisor on what pieces are foundational to your field. Some common tools for conducting background research include:

- Conducting a literature review
- Finding highly cited works
- Reviewing the bibliographies of material you are already reviewing
- Reading scholarly encyclopedia articles

### Who's talking and where?  

Conversations can be exclusive. As a student, you are going to be surrounded by academics, faculty and other students who may have already had a ton of experience in academic discussions. Some voices are louder than others by way of experience and privilege. What can you do to make sure many voices and perspectives, including your own, are heard? Don't limit conversations to one location or voice in your own research. Conversations are happening everywhere-- blogs, newspapers, academic journals, conferences and interpersonally in community discussions. Here are some tips:

- Gather a range of information types and perspectives to get the big picture
- Don't limit yourself to single source types and publishers
- Include competing voices and perspectives in your research and bibliographies. You don't have to agree with the perspectives you include!
- Get outside your academic department and community to find out what others are saying
- Look into community impacts of the research that you are doing, and include voices who are most impacted by the work that you're doing. Better yet, collaborate with those communities to fully inform your projects!

**The conversation is ongoing and never-ending.** You have a role to play in advancing knowledge, no matter what perspective or experiences you bring. So keep asking questions and talking, because the more information you learn, the more ready you'll be to enter the dialogue.

### Research Assistants

Some of you may be, or are interested in becoming, Research Assistants (RAs). An RA is an academic student employee of the University who works with staff or faculty on a research project or area. RAs are found in many colleges and departments and are important players in the research done in their department.

One of the challenges of working as an RA is that you may be asked to conduct research on topics that are new to you, and that may or may not align well with your individual research interests. However, this challenge is balanced by the considerable opportunities afforded by RA-ships, not the least of which is the opportunity to develop valuable research skills and networks that you can eventually apply to your own academic careers.

You can find RA opportunities, as well as other assistantships, [here](https://grad.uw.edu/graduate-student-funding/for-students/assistantships/).
