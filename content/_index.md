The Graduate Student Research Institute (GSRI) is a free and online pre-fall program (non-credited) offered by the UW Libraries and Graduate School Core Programs, aimed at giving new and continuing UW graduate students the tools and strategies they need to research smarter, not harder.

GSRI is highly recommended for incoming graduate students, new Research Assistants, and students in programs that emphasize research or capstones.
